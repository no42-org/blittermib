# blittermib

**Pixelperfect MIB browser** — browse SNMP MIBs, beautifully.

A self-hostable, browser-based reference tool for SNMP MIB files. Drop
a directory of MIBs and get a typographically-disciplined web UI that
lets you search, navigate, and understand them — without sending
anything to a third party.

## Features

- **Search-first navigation** — `⌘K` palette over symbol names, OIDs,
  modules, and full-text descriptions
- **Semantic table rendering** — SMIv2 tables show their columns inline,
  with `INDEX` columns flagged
- **Cross-references** — every symbol page lists what indexes,
  augments, groups, or notifications reference it
- **OpenNMS event export** — modules with notifications offer a
  `↓ events.xml` download (`/m/{name}/events.xml`): an OpenNMS
  eventconf document, one `<event>` per `NOTIFICATION-TYPE`/`TRAP-TYPE`.
  Scalar varbinds are referenced by OID (`%parm[{oid}.0]%`, robust to
  reordering); columnar varbinds stay position-based. UEI base
  overridable via `?uei=`
- **Hot reload** — drop a MIB anywhere under the watched directory and
  it appears in seconds (recursive `fsnotify` + 250 ms debounce +
  transactional ingest)
- **Self-hosted** — single binary, no telemetry, no phone-home
- **Standard MIBs included** — IETF/IANA core MIBs ship in the corpus
  alongside vendor MIBs; refresh via `make fetch-standard-mibs && make ingest`
- **Diagnostics surface** — parse failures show file, line, severity,
  and code; failed MIBs never block successful ones
- **Two interactive islands** — virtualised `⌘K` palette over the
  search API + inline glossary popovers with `localStorage` dismissal

## Quickstart

### Docker

The published image ships the curated corpus (~322 standard IETF/IANA
MIBs) baked in, so you can run it without cloning anything:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/no42-org/blittermib:latest
```

To layer your own MIBs on top of the baked-in corpus, bind-mount a
host directory at `/var/lib/blittermib/mibs/upload` — the watcher
picks them up alongside the standard corpus:

```bash
mkdir -p ./my-mibs
# drop your .mib / .txt / .my files into ./my-mibs
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
    -v "$PWD/my-mibs:/var/lib/blittermib/mibs/upload:ro" \
    ghcr.io/no42-org/blittermib:latest
```

Or with `compose.yml` (uses a named data volume for the SQLite DB and
auto-restart on failure):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/no42-org/blittermib.git
cd blittermib
mkdir -p mibs/upload
# drop your MIBs into mibs/upload/ — they'll be layered on top of
# the corpus that ships in the image.
docker compose up
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>.

#### Routing uploaded MIBs into the corpus

The image ships `blittermib-ingest`, the same classify-and-route tool
contributors use: it moves files from `mibs/upload/` to their
canonical corpus paths (`vendors/{PEN}-{slug}/`, `ietf/{group}/`,
`iana/`, low-confidence to `unsorted/`), dedupes byte-identical
copies, and refuses to overwrite modules already in the corpus.
Running it against a deployment needs the **whole corpus**
bind-mounted **read-write** (moves cross directories), which masks
the corpus baked into the image — image upgrades then no longer
refresh the standard MIBs; you own the tree from that point on.

One-time setup — seed the host tree from the image, chown to the
container user (uid 1000), and switch `compose.yml` to the
operator-managed-corpus mount (see the commented variant there):

```bash
# trailing /. copies the directory CONTENTS — ./mibs already exists
# (the quickstart created ./mibs/upload), and without it docker cp
# would nest the corpus at ./mibs/mibs/.
docker compose cp blittermib:/var/lib/blittermib/mibs/. ./mibs
# docker cp writes root-owned files on rootful Linux
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 mibs
# volumes: REPLACE the upload-only line with
#   - ./mibs:/var/lib/blittermib/mibs
# (keeping both would leave upload/ read-only inside the container
# and block ingest moves)
docker compose up -d
```

Then, per batch of incoming MIBs:

```bash
# 1. drop files into ./mibs/upload/ (subdirectories are fine)

# 2. optional read-only pre-flight: dupes, collisions, broken files.
#    A non-zero exit means the report FOUND actionable findings —
#    that's it working, not crashing. Review the output, then proceed.
docker compose exec blittermib blittermib-ingest --report \
    --src /var/lib/blittermib/mibs/upload --root /var/lib/blittermib

# 3. collapse byte-identical duplicates, then route
docker compose exec blittermib blittermib-ingest --auto-collapse-identical \
    --src /var/lib/blittermib/mibs/upload --root /var/lib/blittermib \
    --no-index
```

`--no-index` is required in-container: the post-ingest `make index`
step needs the repo checkout, and `INDEX.yaml` has no runtime role.
The running server's watcher picks the moves up immediately — no
restart. Files that don't parse or would collide with an existing
corpus module stay in `upload/` for review — the ingest summary
lists each with its reason. (`/diagnostics` shows warnings for
modules that did load; a file that failed to parse never reaches
it.)

Two bounds to know for bulk imports:

- The compile pass is time-bounded as a hang backstop, scaled to the
  batch (`max(5m, 1s × files)`) so bulk drops never trip it in normal
  operation. `--compile-timeout` overrides the default (`0` disables
  the bound). If the bound does fire, the cut-off files are reported
  as one "compile budget exhausted" rollup — they stay in `upload/`
  and a re-run picks them up.
- The import search path (SMIPATH) is walked at boot, so a module
  importing from a corpus directory the ingest *just created* shows
  unresolved-import diagnostics until the next start. Finish any
  batch that created new vendor directories with one
  `docker compose restart blittermib`.

### Bare metal

Requires Go 1.26+ and libsmi (`smidump`, `smilint`):

```bash
brew install libsmi                       # macOS
sudo apt install libsmi2-dev smitools     # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dnf install libsmi-devel             # Fedora / RHEL

git clone https://github.com/no42-org/blittermib.git
cd blittermib
make build
./blittermib -mibs ./mibs
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

The chart is published as an OCI artifact on GHCR. The chart version
equals the blittermib release version — one number for install,
upgrade, and signature verification alike:

```bash
helm install blittermib oci://ghcr.io/no42-org/charts/blittermib --version <version>
kubectl port-forward svc/blittermib 8080:8080   # then open http://localhost:8080
```

blittermib is **single-instance** (`replicaCount: 1`) — the SQLite cache
is per-pod and uploads are node-local, so it doesn't scale horizontally.
Common values:

| Value | Default | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `persistence.enabled` | `false` | Persist the SQLite cache + uploads in a PVC (else an `emptyDir` rebuilt on restart; switches the deploy strategy to `Recreate`). |
| `uploads.enabled` | `false` | Enable the in-browser MIB upload (`BLITTERMIB_UPLOAD_ENABLED`); pair with `persistence.enabled` to keep uploads. |
| `extraMibs.enabled` + `extraMibs.files` | `false` / `{}` | Layer vendor MIBs declaratively via a ConfigMap mounted at `mibs/extra` (≤ ~1 MiB total). |
| `ingress.enabled` | `false` | Expose via a classic `Ingress`. |
| `httpRoute.enabled` | `false` | Expose via a Gateway API `HTTPRoute` (set `httpRoute.parentRefs` to an existing Gateway). Mutually exclusive with `ingress`. |

The chart pins the official image (it bundles libsmi, which the binary
needs at runtime) — don't override `image.repository` with a stripped
rebuild.

### Verifying releases

Everything the release pipeline publishes is signed with
[cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) **keyless signing**: the
signing identity is this repository's `release.yml` workflow (no
project-held keys exist), and every signature is recorded in the
public Rekor transparency log.

`<version>` below is the release version with the `v` stripped (e.g.
`0.8.0`) — image tag and chart version are the same number.

```bash
IDENTITY='^https://github.com/no42-org/blittermib/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-[0-9A-Za-z.-]+)?$'
ISSUER='https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'

# container image — the digest signature also covers `latest`
cosign verify ghcr.io/no42-org/blittermib:<version> \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="$IDENTITY" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="$ISSUER"

# Helm chart (OCI artifact)
cosign verify ghcr.io/no42-org/charts/blittermib:<version> \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="$IDENTITY" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="$ISSUER"

# release tarballs — verify the signed checksums file (the
# .sigstore.json bundle carries signature, certificate, and
# transparency-log entry), then chain:
cosign verify-blob SHA256SUMS \
  --bundle SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="$IDENTITY" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="$ISSUER"
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing   # macOS: shasum -a 256 -c
```

The identity regexp deliberately pins the repository, the workflow
file, *and* the tag-ref shape — a signature from any other workflow
(or a non-tag ref) fails verification.

## Configuration

```
Flags:
  -mibs PATH      MIB corpus directory              (./mibs)
  -data PATH      directory for SQLite + state      (./data)
  -listen ADDR    HTTP listen address               (:8080)
  -v              verbose logging                   (DEBUG level)
  -version        print version and exit
```

Environment variables:

```
  BLITTERMIB_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true
       Expose POST /api/v1/upload (drop zone on the landing page)
       and DELETE /api/v1/upload/{name}. Off by default. This is an
       UNAUTHENTICATED write surface — only enable on deployments
       you control end-to-end (private LAN, reverse proxy with auth,
       single-user dev box). Files land in mibs/upload/ and load
       through the same watcher pipeline as files copied with `cp`.
```

URL surfaces:

```
   /                       landing
   /m, /m/{module}         module index + detail
   /s/{module}::{name}     canonical symbol page
   /o/{oid}                OID lookup → 302 to /s/...
   /search?q=…             search results
   /diagnostics            parse warnings + errors
   /api/v1/search?q=…      JSON for the ⌘K palette
   /api/v1/symbol/{m}/{n}  symbol JSON
   /static/*               embedded design system + JS islands
   /healthz, /version      ops endpoints

   When BLITTERMIB_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true (off by default):
   /upload                 management page: drop zone + file list
   /api/v1/upload          multi-file POST → mibs/upload/, sync compile
   /api/v1/upload/{name}   DELETE single file from mibs/upload/
```
